## **Git best practices**

1. **Commit Frequently and Keep Commits Atomic**
- Make frequent, small commits that represent logical changes.
- Keep each commit atomic, focusing on a single task or feature.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of each change.

2. **Branching Strategy**
- Use a branching strategy that fits your team's workflow (e.g., Gitflow, GitHub Flow).
- Create feature branches for new development and bug fix branches for addressing issues.
- Avoid long-lived branches to minimize merge conflicts and divergence.

3. **Pull Requests**
- Use pull requests (or merge requests) for code reviews and collaboration.
- Require code reviews before merging changes into the main branch.
- Discuss and address feedback received during code reviews before merging.
